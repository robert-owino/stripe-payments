## Installation

To use this website navigation system in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:

   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the website.
   - `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the website.
   - `app.js`: JavaScript code for handling the sidebar and submenu behavior.
   - `data.js`: JavaScript data file containing the links and icons for the submenu.

3. Link the necessary files in your `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Add the necessary meta tags, title, and font-awesome link -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Include the HTML content here -->
    <script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

4. Customize the `data.js` file in accordance with your website's pages and links.

## Usage

1. The sidebar can be toggled open by clicking the "hamburger" button in the navigation header.
2. The submenu will appear when hovering over specific buttons in the sidebar. It will display relevant links with their respective icons.
3. The submenu disappears when moving the cursor away from the sidebar or the button.
4. You can customize the links and icons in the `data.js` file to match your website's pages and preferences.
